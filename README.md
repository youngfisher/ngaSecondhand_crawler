Nga website uses a cookie system that each time you visit a new page or refresh the current one, the cookie changes,which will be used to cross validate 
with the one on the server. If unmatched, you will be denied access. Fortunately, this cookie is set in the form of javascript, which otherwise would casuse big headache.

You need to add your own information before using. Account, password, and reveiver.
